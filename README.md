## What is OGFN Launcher?

OGFN Launcher is an open-source launcher for **OG Fortnite private servers**.

The goal is simple: give you one place to manage your Fortnite builds, connect to a backend, and launch the game without having to manually deal with a bunch of files and commands.

The launcher is **backend-agnostic**, meaning it isn't made for one specific private server. You can configure the backend you want to use.

The interface is built with regular HTML, CSS and JavaScript and runs inside **Microsoft Edge WebView2**. The native parts of the launcher are handled by C++.

> **Currently supported: Windows 10 and Windows 11 only.**

## Features

### Build Library

- Import Fortnite builds you already have
- Keep multiple builds in one place
- Add notes and launch settings for each build
- Download builds from a configured archive

### Downloads

- Resumable downloads
- Chunked downloads for large builds
- Automatic retries
- SHA-256 verification
- Manifest-based build information

Large builds can be tens of gigabytes, so the launcher is designed to handle interrupted downloads without starting over.

### Launching

- Launch builds with one click
- Custom launch arguments for each build
- Multiple clients
- Basic process monitoring

### Backend

- Configure your own backend URL
- Epic-style authentication
- Token verification
- Backend status information
- News feed support

The launcher itself doesn't depend on one specific OGFN backend.

### Updates

- Launcher self-updater
- Stable and beta release channels
- Version checking

### Quality of life

- Settings page
- Build notes
- Structured logs
- Light/dark themes
- Custom accent colors
- Backend news and status

## How it works

The launcher is split into two main parts:

```

### Web UI

The UI lives in `src/web`.

It uses:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

There are **no frontend frameworks**.

### Native core

The native code lives in `src/native`.

It handles things that need access to Windows, such as:

- Downloading files
- Checking file hashes
- Starting Fortnite
- Monitoring processes
- Saving configuration
- Updating the launcher

The UI communicates with the C++ core through a small JSON message bridge.

---

## Native modules

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `main.cpp` | Creates the Windows window and WebView2 environment |
| `bridge.cpp` | Handles communication between JavaScript and C++ |
| `downloads.cpp` | Downloads, resumes and verifies files |
| `crypto.cpp` | SHA-256 verification |
| `process.cpp` | Starts and monitors Fortnite processes |
| `config.cpp` | Saves launcher settings |
| `updater.cpp` | Checks for and installs launcher updates |

---

## Requirements

OGFN Launcher currently supports **Windows only**.

### Supported

- Windows 10 1809 or newer
- Windows 11
- 64-bit Windows

### For building from source

You'll need:

- Visual Studio 2022
- Desktop development with C++
- MSVC v143
- CMake 3.20+
- WebView2 SDK

WebView2 is already included with modern versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11. The installer can also install it if needed.

---

## Installing

Download the latest release from the GitHub Releases page.

Run the installer and start OGFN Launcher.

On the first launch:

1. Enter your backend URL.
2. Log in.
3. Import a Fortnite build or choose one from your configured archive.
4. Launch the build.

That's it.

---

## Building from source

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git
cd REPO
```

Configure the project:

```bash
cmake -B build
```

Build it:

```bash
cmake --build build --config Release
```

For development, you can run a Debug build and edit the web files without rebuilding the whole UI every time.

---

## Configuration

The launcher stores its configuration here:

```text
%APPDATA%\OGFNLauncher\config.json
```

Example:

```json
{
  "backendUrl": "https://your-ogfn-backend.example.com",
  "releaseChannel": "stable",
  "defaultBuildPath": "D:/Games/Fortnite Builds",
  "launchArguments": {},
  "keepLogs": true
}
```

You normally won't need to edit this file manually.

---

## Backend API

The launcher is designed to work with different OGFN backends.

A backend can provide things like authentication, available builds, news and server status.

The current API contract is:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/account/api/oauth/token` | Login |
| `GET` | `/account/api/oauth/verify` | Check authentication |
| `GET` | `/launcher/api/news` | Launcher news |
| `GET` | `/launcher/api/manifest` | Available builds |
| `GET` | `/launcher/api/status` | Backend status |

The launcher only handles the parts it needs. Once Fortnite starts, the game communicates with the backend normally.
